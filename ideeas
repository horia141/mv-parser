* checks
  * fsm:state jump list is empty.
  * fsm:state jump list jump state exists as a state.
  * fsm:clock and reset signals are provided.
  * fsm:state named Reset exists.
  * mod:check inst kind exists.
  * mod:check attrlist and nvPairList match for instances.
  * duplicate names.
  * check all module lookups and searches for failure.

* do proper handling of "toplevel". generateExpr should know when a symbol is a constant or a wire etc.
* get rid of tab parameter to generateDefs. indent does a better job handling indentation.
* change indent : it should only indent it's parameter.
* add group : takes a list of strings and joins them with newlines, skipping empty elements or elements composed just of whitespace. leading and ending whitespace is trimmed for all list elements.
* don't check instantations of modules from .v files .
* proper error handling for command line options.
* modules inside of other modules.
* see if there's a way to unify fsms with mods.
* add textual state descriptions for each state in a fsm.
* split front-end and back-end. front-end should handle mv, Verilog and Verilog with mv annotations, VHDL and VHDL with annotations with separate parsers, and back-end should generate Verilog and VHDL with separate generators.
